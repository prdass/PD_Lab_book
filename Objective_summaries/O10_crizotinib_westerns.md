# H3122 and CR-H3122 Crizotinib Westerns
## Aim: Measure the change in expression of SRC and p-SRC in H3122 and CR-H3122 cells after treatment with crizotinib.

#### Replicate 1 (24 hours drug treatment):

##### Sample Preparation
* 3/02/20 [Day 1 - Seeding](../Daily_lab_book/LB_20-02-03.md)
* 4/02/20 [Day 2 - Drug treatment](../Daily_lab_book/LB_20-02-04.md)
* 5/02/20 [Day 3 - Cell lysis](../Daily_lab_book/LB_20-02-05.md)\
Samples were stored at -80C.
* 7/02/20 [BCA assay and sample prep](../Daily_lab_book/LB_20-02-07.md) (135ng total protein per sample)

* 10/02/20 [Running gel and 1* antibody](../Daily_lab_book/LB_20-02-10.md)
  - 7.5% gel
  - 13.5ug protein per well/20uL total
  - 1* antibodies were SRC, p-SRC and b-actin

* 11/02/20 [2* antibody and imaging](../Daily_lab_book/LB_20-02-11.md)

Overall succesful for a practise but need to improve:

- Getting both b-actins to show up
- Getting better protein yield

#### Replicate 2 (24 hours drug treatment):

##### Sample Preparation
* 10/02/20 [Day 1 - Seeding](../Daily_lab_book/LB_20-02-10.md)
* 11/2/20 [Day 2 - Drug treatment](../Daily_lab_book/LB_20-02-11.md)
* 5/02/20 [Day 3 - Cell lysis] (../Daily_lab_book/LB_20-02-05.md)\
Samples were stored at -80C.
* 7/02/20 [BCA assay and sample prep] (../Daily_lab_book/LB_20-02-07.md) (135ng total protein per sample)
