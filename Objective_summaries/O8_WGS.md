# H3122 and CR-H3122 whole genome sequencing
## Aim: Use WGS to sequence the H3122 and CR-H3122 cell lines to identify resistance mutations. <br>

#### Clonal amplification of H3122 and CR-H3122 cell lines

To reduce the genetic variability in the cell lines and therefore the gDNA samples, both cell lines were clonally purified. To do this the samples of both cells were sorted [using FACS](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-10-25.md) to get one cell into each well into a 96-well plate.

One H3122 colony from the FACS plate was transferred to a 24-well plate, then to a 6-well plate and then a small flask. 3 vials of these cells have frozen in liquid nitrogen.

#### gDNA extraction
gDNA was extracted from the clonally purified H3122 cells, however the yield/quality was not good enough for WGS:

#### Preparation of gDNA for WGS
The protocol was modified to allow more time for the proteinase K lysis to work.

gDNA yield from H3122 cells:

DNA protocol was modified to allow 1 hour for Proteinase K digestion step. DNA was extracted from both clonally purifed H3122 cells and P4 CR-H3122 cells and prepared for sequencing.

Crizotinib resistance of the clonally purified cells was tested to see if it had changed significantly due to the FACS/expansion process.

IC50 was 8.218e-008M.
