## Overview

H3122 cells need to have their media replaced approximately every two days to keep cells healthy.
RPMI1640 media will turn from pink-red to yellow when nutrients are depleted (phenol red changes colour depending on pH).

## Materials

### RPMI1640 media (Thermofisher)

| Additive |  Final Concentration   |
| :------  | :-------- |
| FBS | 5% |
| Penicillin/Streptomycin  | 1% |

Warm to 37°C before use.

## Methods

### Cell culture hood setup

1. UV treat hood for at least 15 minutes
2. Spray and wipe down with 70% ethanol
3. Warm media and any supplements to 37°C in water bath
4. Spray all equipment and flasks with 70% ethanol before putting in hood
5. Spray down after finishing and removing all equipment


### Changing media
1. Media needs to be changed when colour changes from pink-red to more yellow
2. In hood remove all old media with serological pipette
3. Add 20mL of pre-warmed media
4. Spray flask with 70% ethanol and return to incubator

### Notes
1. Be careful with lid to prevent filter getting wet
2. Spray anything that goes into the hood with 70% ethanol
