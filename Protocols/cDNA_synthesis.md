## Overview

Converting cDNA to RNA

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Materials

DNAse enzyme
DNAse buffer
Extracted RNA
DNAse/RNAse free water
STOP (DNAse stopping reagent)
cDNA master mix


------------------------------------------------------------------
## Methods

In the final reaction aim for 500ng/20uL of cDNA -> this means adding 500ng of RNA to the intial 10uL reaction
### DNAse
Total reaction - 10uL in a 0.2mL tube
- 1uL DNAse enzyme
- 1uL DNAse buffer
- 500ng RNA (volume depends on RNA concentration)
- Remaining volume made up to 10uL with RNAse free water

Incubate in PCR machine for 30 minutes at 37°C (DNAse 1 program on Wise PCR machine)
> Reaction will be held at 4°C after all incubations the 30 minutes is over to allow for leeway

### DNAse inactivation

Add 1uL of STOP to the tube (11uL total).

Incubate in PCR machine for 5 minutes at 85°C (DNAse 2 program on Wise PCR machine)

### cDNA synthesis

Add 4uL cDNA master mix and 5uL RNAse free water to the tube (20uL volume total).

Incubate the tube for 5 mins at 25°C, 60 minutes at 42°C, and 5 minutes at 85°C(cDNA program on Wise PCR machine).

Store cDNA at -20°C in a non-cyclic freezer.
