## Methods

### Preparing cells for FACS

1.	Cells (grown in medium flasks) were visualized under the cell culture room microscope and should be ~80% confluent.
2.	Following removal of media from the medium flask (using aseptic technique in the cell culture hood), cells were washed with prewarmed PBS and trypsinised by adding 1 mL of TrypLE (for H3122 cells) or 10x trypsin (for CR-H3122 cells) per flask and incubating at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 3 min.
3.	9mL of prewarmed fresh RPMI 1640 media (5% FBS for H3122 cells, 10% for CR-H3122 cells, 1% Pen-Strep for both) was added to each flask.
4.	Samples were passed through sterile 70 um cell strainers into 50 mL falcon tubes.
5.	Cells were harvested by centrifugation (1200RPM , 3 min at room temperature).
6.	Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mL sterile MACS buffer.
7.	Cells were split into two 0.5mL aliquots, transferred into 15mL falcon tubes and 5ml of sterile MACS buffer were added
8.	Cells were again harvested by centrifugation (300 xg, 5 min at room temperature).
9.	Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5 mL sterile MACS buffer and placed on ice to generate the following samples:
1.	H3122 cells
2.	CR-H3122 cells
10.	To prepare the 96 well plates, 200uL of media was added to each well with a multichannel pipette to generate the following plates:
1.	5% FBS for H3122 cells
2.	10% FBS for CR-H3122 cells
3.	10% FBS + 0.4mM crizotinib for CR-H3122 cells.
4.	10% FBS + 0.8mM crizotinib for CR-H3122 cells.
11.	The samples, 96 well bottom  plates and spare MACS buffer were taken over to the Microbiology building, 4th floor Room 414.
12.	A single cell was sorted into the inside wells in the 96 well plate (60 cells/plate).
13.	Plates were transported back to the lab on ice
14.	Incubate cell cultures at 37°C, 5% CO2.


### Media changing single cell colonies (every 3 - 4 days)
-	Replace media in 96-well trays with prewarmed fresh RPMI 1640. (Use a multichannel pipette to remove and replace media). Remove media from all wells – one plate at a time. Then replace with freshly made CGM. I use the lid of a new cell culture plate to use as a reservoir for multichannel pipette to keep everything sterile.
-	Monitor growth by microscopy, I generally start expanding clones (over 60% confluent) after 1.5-2 weeks. (You can also plate some reasonably confluent cells in another plate to help focus microscope).
