## Overview

How to extract RNA from cell lines

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Materials

PBS\
Qiagen Buffer RLT (lysis buffer)



------------------------------------------------------------------
## Methods

### Cell lysis
- From typsinised cells take 10^6 cells and put them in an eppendorf in 1mL of media total.
- Spin down the cells for 5 mins at 1800 RPM for 5 minutes.
- Very carefully remove the supernatant with a pipette (easy to lose the pellet by accident)
- Resuspend the pellet in 1mL of PBS and spin again
- Remove the supernatant, resuspend the pellet again in 1mL of PBS, spin
- Remove the supernatant
- Resuspend the pellet in 600uL (can use as little as 350uL) of RLT buffer
- Pass the resuspended cells through a ___ gauge syringe slowly 20 times to further lyse the cells

>PAUSE POINT: cells in RLT buffer can be stored at -80Â°C until the next steps
