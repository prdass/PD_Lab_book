## Overview

How to extract RNA from cell lines

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Materials

PBS\
Qiagen Buffer RLT (lysis buffer)



------------------------------------------------------------------
## Methods

### Cell lysis
- From typsinised cells take 10^6 cells and put them in an eppendorf in 1mL of media total.
- Spin down the cells for 5 mins at 1800 RPM for 5 minutes.
- Very carefully remove the supernatant with a pipette (easy to lose the pellet by accident)
- Resuspend the pellet in 1mL of PBS and spin again
- Remove the supernatant, resuspend the pellet again in 1mL of PBS, spin
- Remove the supernatant
- Resuspend the pellet in 600uL (can use as little as 350uL) of RLT buffer
- Pass the resuspended cells through a ___ gauge syringe slowly 20 times to further lyse the cells

>PAUSE POINT: cells in RLT buffer can be stored at -80°C until the next steps

### RNA extraction

**Be aware of RNAse contamination. Always be aware of which surfaces are clean or unclean and change gloves or use RNAse Away spray as needed.**

- If lysed cells have been frozen let them thaw
- Add an equal volume of ethanol.
- Load 700uL of the mixture into a spin column and centrifuge at 13000RPM for 60 seconds
- Empty the flow-through from the bottom of the spin column, load the remaining cells/ethanol into the column and spin it again 13000RPM/60 seconds. Discard flow-through
- Add 600uL wash buffer, centrifuge 13000RPM/30 seconds, discard flow-through.
- Repeat previous step
- Centrifuge the column 13000RPM/3 minutes to completely remove any remaining wash buffer.
- Place the column in a new collection tube.
- Add 30-50uL of RNAse free water to the column by carefully dripping it directly onto the column.
- Centrifuge 13000RPM/60 seconds
- Transfer RNA to a clean eppendorf. From this aliquot 3uL in a separate tube for nanodropping.
- Store at -80°C.
