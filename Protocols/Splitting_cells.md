## Overview

Once cells become confluent and start growing on top of each other they need to be removed from that flask, diluted, then added to another flask. Each time this is done the cells gain a passage number.

The volumes for the protocol are given for a 75cm^3 flask, double for 175cm^3 flask.

## Materials

### RPMI1640 media (Thermofisher) for ELM4-ALK H3122 cells

| Additive |  Final Concentration   |
| :------  | :-------- |
| FBS | 5% |
| Penicillin/Streptomycin  | 1% |

### TrypLE (Trypsin)
TrypLE™ Express Enzyme (1X), no phenol red

### Phosphate-buffed saline (PBS)

### Equipment
Serological pipettes
Haemocytometer

## Methods

### Removing cells from flask
1. Use a pipette to remove the media from the flask
2. Add 10mL PBS and gently tip the flask back and forth to wash the cells
3. Remove the PBS with a pipette
4. Add 1mL of TrypLE and place the flask in the 37°C incubator for a few minutes
5. Bang the sides of the flask to help the cells detach, incubating for a few more minutes if needed
6. Add 9mL of media to the TrypLE and cells and transfer to a falcon tube
7. Centrifuge at 1200RPM for 3 minutes
8. Remove the supernatant and resuspend in 10mL of fresh media
9. Transfer 1mL of the resuspended cells to a new flask and add 9mL of fresh media



### Notes
FBS neutralises the TrypLE so all media needs to be removed
