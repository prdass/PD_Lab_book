## Materials

### RPMI1640 media (Thermofisher) for ELM4-ALK H3122 cells

| Additive |  Final Concentration   |
| :------  | :-------- |
| FBS | 5% |
| Penicillin/Streptomycin  | 1% |


### RPMI1640 media (Thermofisher) for crizotinib resistant ELM4-ALK H3122 cells

| Additive |  Final Concentration   |
| :------  | :-------- |
| FBS | 10% |
| Crizotinib  | 1 uM |
Warm to 37Â°C before use.

#### Other equipment
- Serological pipette and tips
- Flasks
- Falcon tubes

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Methods

1. Pre-warm media and set up hood with all equipment
2. Pipette 9mL of media into a falcon tube
3. Take vial from liquid nitrogen and place/hold in waterbath until thawed (watch carefully and take out as soon as it's thawed)
4. Transfer the 1mL of thawed cells into the falcon tube with 9mL of media
5. Centrifuge at 1200RPM for 3 minutes to separate the DMSO from the cells
6. Tip of supernatant and resuspend the remaining cells with 10mL of media
7. Transfer the entire contents of the falcon tube to a 75cm3 flask.


### Notes
If there are few cells/cells are slow growing re-suspend in 5 mL and place in a small flask
