## Task 1: Look for single cells in 96 well plate

[Yesterday](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-08-6.md) the 96 well plate for single cell selection of H3122s was set up. Today we looked for wells that had only 1 cell in them. 2 candidate wells were found but quite difficult to find wells with only one cell

### Next
Let the cells grow for one or two days before looking for more single cell colonies
