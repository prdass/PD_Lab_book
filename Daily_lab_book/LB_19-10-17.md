## Overview

Contin CxAxS replicates + getting ready for FACS

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

1. CxAxS SRB 2 day 1
2. Reviving H3122 P4 from frozen

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: CxAxS SRB 2 day 1

Two 96 well plates were seeded with 7000 cells/well with P9 H3122 cells.

### Next
Drug treat tomorrow with crizotinib, selumetinib, ABT-737 and combination.

## Task 2: Reviving H3122 P4 from frozen

The H3122 P4 cells revived [previously](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-10-07.md) were confluent and had to be split. For FACS the H3122 and CR-H3122 cells need to be a similar passage number so more H3122 P4 cells were revived today.

### Next
Maintain the cells and use FACS to sort them into 96 well plates next week
