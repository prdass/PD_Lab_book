## Overview
Working on crizotinib SRB replicates 2 and 5
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks
1. Crizotinib assay 2 Day 5
2. Crizotinib assay 3 Day 1
3. Cell line maintenence

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: Crizotinib assay 2 day 5
Day 5 protocol was carried out up to the acetic acid wash. The plate was not dry after 20 minutes in the gel drier so was left upside down on a paper towel to finish drying <br>
[Protocol](../Protocols/SRB_Cytotoxicity_assay.md)

### Next
Solubilise dye with Tris, measure absorbance and data analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 2: Crizotinib assay 3 day 1

One of the flasks of P7 H3122 split on [27/6/19](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-06-27.md) and the resuspended cells were used to seed a 96 well plate <br>
[Protocol](../Protocols/SRB_Cytotoxicity_assay.md)

The remaining resuspended cells were split 1:10 in a new flask - P8 now
### Next
Treat plate with crizotinib 2pm tomorrow (2/7/19)

---------------------------------
## Task 3: Cell line maintenence

The second flask split on [27/6/19](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-06-27.md) needed a media change <br>
[Protocol](../Protocols/Media_change.md)
### Next
Split flask on Thursday 4/7/18 and use to set up Crizotinib assay 4 day 1
