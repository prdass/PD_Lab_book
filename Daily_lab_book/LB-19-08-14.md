## Overview

Learning to do RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis


------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

1. RNA extraction from 10^6 H3122 cells
2. cDNA synthesis from H3122 RNA

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: RNA extraction from 10^6 H3122 cells

RNA was extracted from the [cells lysed last week](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-08-14.md). RNA yield was 241.190ng/uL (pretty good!!!!)

[RNA extraction protocol](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-08-14.md)

### Next
Convert RNA to cDNA + start keeping track of what reagents we borrowed

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 2: cDNA synthesis from H3122 RNA

RNA from Task 1 was converted to cDNA and stored at -20Â°C.

Protocol to be written up

### Next
Carry out gradient PCR with 3x primer sets on Friday 16/8/19- if we get product send it for sequncing at Anatomy on Monday 19/8/19
