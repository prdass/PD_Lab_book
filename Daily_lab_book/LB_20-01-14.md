## Task 1: Data analysis of selumetinib troubleshooting SRBs

>Recap (from [previous entry](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-12-16.md)):
The selumetinib IC50 results are change quite a bit depending on what replicates are included and whether the data is constrained or not (top = 100 and bottom =0)

| Replicates  | Constrain | IC50 (M)    | IC50 (uM) |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| 7, 8, 9, 11 | Y         | 0.000001996 | 1.996     |
| 7, 8, 9, 11 | N         | 0.00000192  | 1.92      |
| 8, 9, 11    | Y         | 0.000001806 | 1.806     |
| 8, 9, 11    | N         | 0.000001515 | 1.515     |

>To figure out which one is closer to the true IC50 of selumetinib, one plate will be treated with IC50 equivalents to IC50 values of 1.996uM and 1.515uM. The results will be compared to see which concentration kills ~50% of the cells at 1x the IC50 concentration. The drug concentrations can be found in the protocols folder.

The SRB plate was analysed and the results are displayed below:

At 1.996uM 48.3% of the cells were killed compared with 57.5% at 1.515uM (although this is only one replicate).

### Next
Use an IC50 of 1.996 for selumetinib and redo the crizotinib X selumetinib combination SRBs to get better controls.
