## Overview

Preparation of CR H3122 for sequencing and selumetinib SRBs

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

1. Gel purification of CR H3122 ALK_3 PCR product and sequencing set up
2. Selumetinib SRB 9 day 2

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: Gel purification of CR H3122 ALK_3 PCR product and sequencing set up

The [PCR product from yesterday] was purified today using the Thermofisher PureLink Quick Gel Extraction Kit. No modifications were made to the protocol and the optional isoproponol step was omitted.

Using the purified product, 2 reactions were set up:
- Reaction 1: ALK_3 with ALK_3_F primer (CRF)
- Reaction 2: ALK_3 with ALK_3_R primer (CRR)

Each reaction contained 4uL of the purified gel product and 1uL of 3.2pmol primer (1.6uL 10mM primer + 3.4uL filter sterilised water, made last week).

### Next
Drop sequencing reactions on Monday

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 2: Selumetinib SRB 9 day 2

The plate seeded yesterday was treated with selumetinib and incubated at 3pm.

### Next
Aspirate media + fix cells with TCA on Monday 26/8/19 (Abby is doing)
