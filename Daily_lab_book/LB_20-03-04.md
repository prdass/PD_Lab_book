## Task 1: AxS SRB 3 data analysis

The plate was washed, stained and read.
It looks like the ABT is less effective in the AxS SRBs compared with the CxA SRBs from last year. Could be that the drug has degraded/is more prone to precipitation after long term storage in the freezer?

### Next
Make up more ABT 737 stocks and do an SRB comparing them the old and new stocks
