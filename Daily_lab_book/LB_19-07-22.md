## Overview

Continuing with single drug SRB replicates

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

1. Selumetinib assay 4 staining + data analysis
2. Crizotinib assay 5/ selumetinib assay 5 day 5
3. Cell maintenence

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: 1. Selumetinib assay 4 staining

The [protocol](../Protocols/SRB_Cytotoxicity_assay.md) was paused at the first dry step over the weekend. Today protocol was continued from the SRB strain upto the platereader step.

### Next
Analyse the data and add it to the selumetinib prism file

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 2: Crizotinib assay 5/ selumetinib assay 5 day 5

Today [day 5 of the SRB protocol](../Protocols/SRB_Cytotoxicity_assay.md) was carried out until the first drying step. The plate will be stored at room temperature until the next steps are carried out.

### Next
Continue with the rest of the protocol + data analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 3: Cell maintence

The P10 flask [split on 15/7/19](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-07-15.md) was split today 1:30 - passage number is now 11. From the trypsinised cells another P11 flask was made 1:10 for Abby. Media was changed for the P10 flask [split on 18/7/19](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-07-18.md)

### Next
Media change all flasks on Wednesday 24/7/19
