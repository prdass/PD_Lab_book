## Overview

Learning how to strain, read and analyse SRB results + cell maintenance

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

1. Strain drug treated cells and measure absorbance (and therefore drug effect) of cells treated on [Friday](../Daily_lab_book/19-6-21.md) (Crizotinib assay 1)
2. Change media of cells [last changed on Friday](../Daily_lab_book/19-6-21.md)
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: Crizotinib cytotoxicity assay 1 [day 5](../Protocols/Cytotoxicity_assay.md)

Cells were fixed and stained with SRB, stain was solubilised and absorbance  was measured

#### Results
