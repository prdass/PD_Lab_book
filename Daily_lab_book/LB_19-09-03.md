## Overview

Following up on sequencing + combination SRBs
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

1. CxS SRB 1 continuing day 5
2. CxS SRB 2 day 2
3. CR-H3122 sequence analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: CxS SRB 1 continuing day 5

Yesterday the media was removed from the plates and TCA was added. Today the rest of the PCR protocol was carried out and the raw data was added to the Criz_sel_combination folder within the Raw_SRB_data folder.

### Next
Put the raw data in prism for analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 2: CxS SRB 2 day 2

The plates from [yesterday](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-09-02.md) were drug treated today with the crizotinib/selumetinib combination + controls. The  plate was incubated at 2:30pm

### Next
Continue with day 5 of the SRB protocol on Friday 6/9/19.

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 3: CR-H3122 sequence analysis

The sequencing results for the sample [sent yesterday](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-09-02.md) was received today. This sample shows the same 1bp deletion at the end of the sequence, however analysis using Snapgene showed that the forward and reverse ALK_3 primers had actually been mixed up and the corresponding sequence of the opposite strand where the deletion was showed that there was no actual deletion. 

### Next
Look into WGS for the H3122 line
