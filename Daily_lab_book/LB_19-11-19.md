## Task 1: CxAxS SRB 5 and 6 data analysis

The rest of the SRB protocol was carried out for the plates stained yesterday.
The raw data was added to the O6 raw data folder and the prism sheet was updated.
Replicate 7 didn't look very good, no in cell viability across the crizotinib and selumetinib rows and only a bit in the ABT and triple drug rows.

## Task 2: CxAxS SRB 7 day 2

The plates were treated with the triple drug combination and controls.

### Next
Rest of SRB protocol on Friday 22/11/19
