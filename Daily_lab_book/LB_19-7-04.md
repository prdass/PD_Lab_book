## Overview

Setting up final crizotinib assay replicate as well as first selumetinib assay + cell line maintenance
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

Task 1: Crizotinib assay 4/Selumetinib assay 1 Day 1 + splitting cells
Task 2: Media change
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: Crizotinib assay 4/Selumetinib assay 1 Day 1 + splitting cells

The 1:3 flask split by Abby on [2/7/19](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-7-02.md) was split today into a new flask. <br>
[Splitting cells protocol](../Protocols/Splitting_cells.md)<br>
Modification to protocol: After spinning down the cells and resuspending in fresh media, the cells were diluted 1:12 in the new flask instead of 1:10. Hopefully this will slow down the growth enouhgh so that the cells are ready for splitting/SRB assay next Thursday.<br>
[SRB protocol](../Protocols/SRB_Cytotoxicity_assay.md)<br>
The resuspended cells were also used to seed a 96 well plate was seeded with 7000 cells/per well and incubated at 2pm.

### Next
Treat the cells in the 96 well plate with crizotinib and selumetinib and change media of the flask split today on Saturday 6/7/19

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 2: Media change

Media change for H3122 P8 split on [1/7/19](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-7-01.md)

### Next
Media change again on Saturday 6/7/19
