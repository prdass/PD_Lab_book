## Overview

ABT 737 SRBs

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

1. ABT 737 SRB 1 day data analysis
2. Cell maintenance
3. ABT 737 SRB 3 day 1
4. ABT 737 SRB 2 day 5

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: ABT 737 SRB 1 day data analysis

[On Friday](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-09-20.md) day 5 of the SRB protocol was paused after the addition of the TCA. Today the rest of the SRB protocol was carried out and the data was added to a new .xslx file in [Raw data](../Raw_SRB_data/ABT-737_only).

### Next
For next ABT-737 SRB (#3) change the drug concentrations to exclude the lowest one and add another higher concentration (details in tomorrow's lab book entry)

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 2: Cell maintenance

Media was changed for the CR-H3122 P3 flask and the 1:30 H3122 P6 flask split on [19/9/19](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-09-19.md). The 1:10 H3122 P6 (flask also split on 19/9/19) was split today - cell were split into a new flask 1:30 and also used for an SRB plate (below)

### Next

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 3: ABT 737 SRB 3 day 1

From the cells in Task 2 a 96 well plate was set up with P6 H3122 cells for SRB assay

### Next
Drug treat cells tomorrow with ABT-737
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 3: ABT 737 SRB 1 day 5

Day 5 of the SRB protocol was carried out until the TCA wash and dry step. The plate was stored at room temperature overnight

### Next
Finish the SRB protocol and add the data to the spreadsheet tomorrow 24/9/19
