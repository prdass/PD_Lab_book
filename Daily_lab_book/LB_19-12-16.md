## Tasks

1. Troubleshooting selumetinib SRB 1 day 1
2. ABT 24hr Western 1 seeding

## Task 1: Troubleshooting selumetinib SRB 1 day 1

The selumetinib IC50 results are change quite a bit depending on what replicates are included and whether the data is constrained or not (top = 100 and bottom =0)

| Replicates  | Constrain | IC50 (M)    | IC50 (uM) |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| 7, 8, 9, 11 | Y         | 0.000001996 | 1.996     |
| 7, 8, 9, 11 | N         | 0.00000192  | 1.92      |
| 8, 9, 11    | Y         | 0.000001806 | 1.806     |
| 8, 9, 11    | N         | 0.000001515 | 1.515     |

To figure out which one is closer to the true IC50 of selumetinib, one plate will be treated with IC50 equivalents to IC50 values of 1.996uM and 1.515uM. The results will be compared to see which concentration kills ~50% of the cells at 1x the IC50 concentration. The drug concentrations can be found in the protocols folder

## Task 2: ABT 24hr Western 1 seeding

2 petri dishes were each seeded with 1 million H3122 P13 cells.

### Next
Drug treat tomorrow.
