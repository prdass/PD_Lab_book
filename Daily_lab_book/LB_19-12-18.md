## Overview

Making progress on gDNA extraction and ABT westerns
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

1. Split and freeze clonal H3122s
2. gDNA extraction from clonal H3122s
3. ABT 24hr Western 1 cell lysis

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: Split and freeze clonal H3122s

The clonal H3122s in the small flask were about 90% confluent so they were split and divived into 3 cryovials for storage in liquid nitrogen. 2.5 millions cells were taken for gDNA extraction.

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 2: gDNA extraction from clonal H3122s

DNA was extracted from the 2.5 million cells described above. The overall quality and quantity of the gDNA was not ideal for WGS.
100uL of elution buffer was used.

### Next
Grow up a cryovial of clonal H3122s and try again - could try proteinase K overnight potentially

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 3: ABT 24hr Western 1 cell lysis

The cells in the petri dishes were lysed according to the protocol (to be added) and the samples were stored at -80C.

### Next
Make up protein samples next year.
