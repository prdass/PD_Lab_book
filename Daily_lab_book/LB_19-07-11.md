## Overview

Continuing selumetinib SRB replicates + optimising cell splitting
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

1. Splitting cells
2. Setting up selumetinib assay 3 day 1

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: Splitting cells
[Protocol](../Protocol/Splitting_cells.md)<br>
The cells split 1:12 on [4/7/19](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-07-04.md) with the aim of splitting today were confluent - cells need to be diluted more to be able to split every 7 days without cells growing on top of each other.
The other current flask was split on [8/7/19](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-07-08.md) - the cells were diluted 1:20 so that the cells would be ready to split on Monday 15/7/19. However the cells have grown quite quickly and the cells will probably need to be split before Monday.
To get around this the 4/7/19 P8 flask was split today into 2 flasks (P9). One flask has a cells:media ratio of 1:10 and the other has 1:30 - aiming to have the 1:10 flask ready to split on Monday 15/7/19 and the 1:30 ready on 18/7/19.

### Next
Use the resuspended cells to set up 96 well plate for SRB assay

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 2: Selumetinib assay 2 Day 1
[Protocol](../Protocol/SRB_Cytotoxicity_assay)<br>
The resuspended cells from Task 1 were used to seed a 96 well plate - the plate was incubated at 2:30pm.

### Next
Treat the plate with selumetinib at 2:30pm tomorrow
