## Overview

Continuing ABT SRBs
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

1. ABT 737 SRB 2 data analysis
2. ABT 737 SRB 3 day 2
3. Cell maintenance
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: ABT 737 SRB 2 data analysis

Yesterday the plate was stored after the first drying step. Today the rest of the protocol was carried out. The data was added to the .xlsx and prism file for ABT-737.

The IC50 curve so far is good but can shift the concentrations to make it look even better. Instead of continuting with the selumetinib concentrations, a table with the new ABT 737 range of concentrations has been added to the [drug concentrations page](../Protocols/SRB_drug_concentrations.md)
### Next
Treat ABT 737 SRB 3 and all future ABT 737 replicates with the updated concentration range.

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 2: ABT 737 SRB 3 day 2

The plate seeded yesterday was treated with ABT-737 (new concentration range)

### Next
Continue with day 5 of the SRB protocol on Friday 27/9/19
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 3: Cell maintenance

The H3122 flask split on [19/9/19](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-09-19.md) will not be used for SRBs this week  - instead this flask was split today 1:20 and will be used on Monday for an SRB plate (as well as the flask split yesterday - doing 2 replicates at once next week)
