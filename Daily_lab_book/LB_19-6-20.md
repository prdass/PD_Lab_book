## Overview

Learning how to split cells + how to set up day 1 of the SRB cytotoxicity assay

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

1. Split ALK+ H3122 cells


2. Crizotinib cytotoxicity assay #1 [Day 1](../Protocols/SRB_Cytotoxicity_assay.md)

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: Split cells

[H3122 cells were split](../Protocols/Splitting_cells.md)<br>
Passage number is now 5<br>
Cells were moved from a large 175(m^3 flask to a medium 75cm^3 flask

### Next <br>
Change media tomorrow to keep cells happy over the weekend

## Task 2: Crizotinib [cytotoxicity Assay 1 Day 1](../Protocols/SRB_Cytotoxicity_assay.md)

A full 96 well plate was set up with 7000 cells per well using the cells that were split today and incubated at 3pm

#### Dilution calculations:

3 cell counts: **115,110, 180**

Average cell count = **135**

**135 x 10,000 = 1,350,000 cells per mL** in the resuspended cells

To get 7000 cells/well in a 96 well plate: round up to 110 and multiply
**7000 x 110 = 770,000 cells** in 110 wells

Total media volume for 110 wells **150uL x 110 = 16.5mL**

Volume of cells required in 16.5mL **770,000/1,350,000 = 0.5704mL**

**16.5mL - 0.5704mL = 15.93mL** of fresh media

Final dilution = **15.93mL fresh media + 0.57mL resuspended cells**

### Next
Treat with crizotinib dilutions tomorrow
