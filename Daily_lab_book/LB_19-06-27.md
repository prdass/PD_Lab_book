## Overview

Setting up 2nd crizotinib assay and splitting cells into 2 flasks

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks
1. Splitting cells
2. Crizotinib assay 2 Day 1

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: Splitting cells
The flask of cells split by Abby on [24/6/19](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-06-24.md) were split today <br>
[Protocol](../Protocols/Splitting_cells.md)<br>
Modifications to protocol:
Two flasks were made from the cells split today - one with 1:10 dilution of cells to fresh media and one with 1:5 (both 10mL total)<br>
Passage number for both flasks = 7

### Next
Maintain both flasks and use the 1:5 dilution flask to set up crizotinib assay 3 on Monday 1/7/19

## Task 2: Crizotinib cytotoxicity assay 2 Day 1

96 well plate was set up and incubated at 3pm<br>
[Protocol](../Protocols/SRB_Cytotoxicity_assay.md)<br>

#### Dilution calculations:

3 cell counts: **55, 35, 55**

Average cell count = **48.3**

**135 x 10,000 = 483,333.3 cells per mL** in the resuspended cells

To get 7000 cells/well in a 96 well plate: round up to 110 and multiply
**7000 x 110 = 770,000 cells** in 110 wells

Total media volume for 110 wells **150uL x 110 = 16.5mL**

Volume of cells required in 16.5mL **770,000/483,333.3 = 1.6mL**

**16.5mL - 1.6mL = 14.9mL** of fresh media

Final dilution = **14.9mL fresh media + 1.6mL resuspended cells**

### Next

Set up day 2 (crizotinib treatment) tomorrow
