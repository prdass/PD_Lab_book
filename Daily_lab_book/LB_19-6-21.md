## Overview

Learning how to set up crizotinib dilutions for SRB assay + cell maintenance

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

1. Set up drug treatments for cells seeded [yesterday](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-6-20.md)
2. Change media of cells split and inbubated [yesterday](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-6-20.md)
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: Crizotinib cytotoxicity assay 1 [day 2](../Protocols/Cytotoxicity_assay.md)

96 well plate was set up with 10 different concentrations of crizotiniv and five technical replicates per concentration
Incubated at 2:30pm


### Next
Strain with SRB at 2:30pm on Monday 24/6/19 and platereader analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 2: Media change

For H3122 P5 cells
 Carried out according to [protocol](../Protocols/Media_change.md)

### Next
Change media on Monday 24/6/19
