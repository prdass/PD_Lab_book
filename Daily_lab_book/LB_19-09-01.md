## Overview

Following up on sequencing + combination SRBs

## Tasks

1. Resending CR-H3122 for sequencing
2. CxS SRB 1 Day 5
3. CxS SRB  Day 1
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: Resending CR-H3122 for sequencing

The previous sequencing of the CR-H3122 PCR product with the ALK_3 primer pair showed a 1bp deletion near the end of the sequence where the quality was poor. To check whether this deletion is real, the CR-H3122 gel purified PCR product [from 23/8/19](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-08-23.md).

One reaction: 4uL gel purified CR-H3122 PCR product + 1uL ALK_3_R primer

### Next
Wait for sequencing
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 2: CxS SRB 1 Day 5

The media was removed from the plate and TCA was added. The plate has been stored at 4C overnight.

### Next
Continue with the rest of the SRB protocol

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 3:

To check whether the 1bp deletion in the CR-H3122 sequence is a true mutation, the gel purifed PCR product was sent for sequencing again with the ALK_3_R primer.

- Reaction 1: ALK_3 with ALK_3_R primer (CR)
= 4uL of the purified gel product and 1uL of 3.2pmol primer (1.6uL 10mM primer + 3.4uL filter sterilised water).

### Next
Wait for sequencing
