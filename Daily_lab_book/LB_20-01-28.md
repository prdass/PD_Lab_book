## Task 1: H3/ABT/24hr/1 BCA assay and sample prep

Cell lysates from [18/12/19](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-12-18.md) were sonicated and a BCA assay was carried out. \
Notes: the total protein concentration was not high enough to get 300ng of protein so samples were made up to 200ng instead.\
BCA assay is in [Raw_Western_data](../Raw_Western_data)

### Next
Make and run gel.
