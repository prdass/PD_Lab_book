## Task 2: Cell maintenance

The H3122 P4 flask [revived from frozen](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-09-09.md) was split today. The cells were used in Task 1 as well as split into a flask 1:10 (to be split for SRBs on Thursday) and 1:5 (to be frozen down later in the week). Media was changed for the CR-H3122 P3 flask which as also revived on the same day.
