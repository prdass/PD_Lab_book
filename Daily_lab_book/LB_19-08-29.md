## Task 1: Selumetinib SRB 9 data analysis

This plate was seeded on [22/8/19](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-08-22.md). On Monday Day 5 of the protocol was carried out by Abby upto the first drying stage. Today the rest of the protcol was completed and absorbance was measured.



### Next
Add selumetinib 9 data to excel and prism and use it to calculate combination drug treating concentrations

## Task 2: Crizotinib/selumetinib SRB 1 day 1

A large flask with P9 (from Abby) was split today and used to seed 2 96 well plates. The remaining trypsinised cells were split into a new flask (1:10 and 1:30)
