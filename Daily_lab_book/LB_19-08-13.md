## Overview

Starting combination SRB assays, and single cell selection of CR-H3122s for RNA extraction

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

1. Splitting CR-H3122s
2. Setting up single cell selection plate for CR H3122s
3. Cell maintenance
4. Selumetinib SRB 1 day 2

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: Splitting CR-H3122s

The CR-H3122s revived on [25/7/19](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-07-25.md) were split today into a new flask (P4).\
Modification to [protocol](../Protocols/Splitting_cells.md): 10x trypsin was used instead of 1x TrypleE because CR-H3122s are highly adherent

### Next
When cells are ready to split again, take 10^6 cells and perform RNA extraction to work out how many cells are needed to get sufficient DNA.

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 2: Setting up single cell selection plate for CR-H3122s

A 96 well plate was set up from the trypsinised cells from Task 1.

### Next
Check plate every two days to look for wells with single cell colonies.

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 3: Cell maintenance

Media was changed for the H3122 P13 flask split on [8/8/19](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-08-08.md)

### Next
Use flask to set up SRB plates on Thursday 15/8/19

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 4: S8 day 2

Cells were treated with selumetinib (need to to one more replicate because only have 2x done with serum) and incubated at 3pm


### Next
Continue day 5 of the SRB protocol on Monday 18/8/19
