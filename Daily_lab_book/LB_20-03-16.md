## Overview

Continuing with combination SRBs and collecting western samples
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

1. Old vs new SRB data analysis
2. Western samples - H3/criz/24 #2 and #3, CR/criz/24 #1 day 1
3. SRBs - AxS #1, AxS #2, clonal H3122 crizotinib day 1
4. Western samples - lyse H3/ABT/48/#3

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: Old vs new SRB data analysis

The SRB from last week was analysed - the older ABT stock had a higher IC50 than the newer stock, indicating the stock had degraded/become less effective.

### Next
Use new stock to get 3 replicates of ABT x selumetinib combination SRBs

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 2: Western samples - H3/criz/24 #2 and #3, CR/criz/24 #1 day 1

6 petri dishes were set up:
H3/criz/24 #2 (P14)
H3/criz/24 #3 (different P14)
CR/criz/24 #1 (P10)

### Next
Drug treat tomorrow

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 3: SRBs - AxS #1, AxS #2, clonal H3122 crizotinib day 1

3 sets of plates were set up:
AxS #1 (P14)
AxS #2 (different P14)
Clonal H3122 crizotinib test (P1)

### Next
Drug treat tomorrow

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 4: Western samples - lyse H3/ABT/48/#3

The cells were lysed and stored at -20C.

### Next
BCA assay and sample prep
