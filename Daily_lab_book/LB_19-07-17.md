## Overview

Redoing data analysis for crizotinib and selumetinib SRBs and cell maintence
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

1. Redoing data analysis for existing crizotinib and selumetinib SRB results
2. Cell maintence

## Task 1: Redoing data analysis for existing crizotinib and selumetinib SRB results

As described in [yesterday's entry](../Daily_lab_book/) the excel analysis was not done properly for most of the SRB replicates (excluding crizotinib 1 and selumetinib 3). Instead of calculating the cell viability as a percentage of the DMSO control I was calculating the cell viability for each concentration as a percentage of the next lowest concentration. <br>

The % of DSMO calculations have been corrected and the [raw excel files](../Raw_SRB_data) have been updated.

In the existing Crizotinib_assay_1.pzfx and Selumetinib_only.pzfx files the incorrect values have been replaced with the correct values.

## Task 2: Cell maintence

Media was changed for the P10 and P9 H3122 cells [according to protocol](../Protocols/Media_change.md)

### Next
Split the P9 flask and set up two 96 well plates (not sure if will be doing another selumetinib replicate or 1st combination assay) for SRBs tomorrow (18/7/19) + change media for the P10 flask on Friday 19/7/19
