## Task 1: Redoing data analysis for existing crizotinib and selumetinib SRB results

As described in [yesterday's entry](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-07-17.md) the excel analysis was not done properly for most of the SRB replicates (excluding crizotinib 1 and selumetinib 3). Instead of calculating the cell viability as a percentage of the DMSO control I was calculating the cell viability for each concentration as a percentage of the next lowest concentration. <br>

**Raw data**
The % of DSMO calculations have been corrected and the [raw excel files](../Raw_SRB_data) have been updated.In the existing Crizotinib_assay_1.pzfx and Selumetinib_only.pzfx files the incorrect values have been replaced with the correct values.

**Object summaries**
The graphs and IC50 values from the incorrect data have been removed from the [crizotinib](../Objective_summaries/Crizotinib_cytotoxicity_assays.md) and [selumetinib](../Objective_summaries/Selumetinib_cytotoxicity_assays.md) objective summaries and updated with the graphs using the corrected data (incorrect graphs are still in [figure cache](../Daily_lab_book/Figure_cache) for now).

**Additional replicates**
After redoing the analysis - crizotinib replicate 2 is quite different from 3 and 4, and all the selumetinib replicates are quite different from each other so I need to do at least one more replicate for each.


### Next
Set up a 96 well plate tomorrow and on Friday 18/7/19 treat with selumetinib and crizotinib to get one more replicate for each drug.

## Task 2: Cell maintence

Media was changed for the P10 and P9 H3122 cells [according to protocol](../Protocols/Media_change.md)

### Next
Split the P9 flask and set up a 96 well plate (crizotinib 5 and selumetinib 4) for SRBs tomorrow (18/7/19) + change media for the P10 flask on Friday 19/7/19
