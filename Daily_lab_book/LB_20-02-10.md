2. AxS SRB 2 day 1
3. H3/criz/24/2 day 1 (for western)
4. H3/ABT/48/1 day 1 (for western)
5. H3/criz/24/1 running gel + transfer + 1* antibody
6.
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: CxS SRB 2 day 1

2x 96-well plates were set up with P7 H3122 cells.

### Next
Drug treat tomorrow with crizotinib, selumetinib and combination

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 2: AxS SRB 2 day 1

2x 96-well plates were set up with P7 H3122 cells.

### Next
Drug treat tomorrow with ABT-737, selumetinib and combination

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 3: H3/criz/24/2 day 1 (for western)

2 petri dishes were seeded with 1 million P7 H3122 cells each.

### Next
Treat tomorrow with crizotinib and DMSO control

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 4: H3/ABT/48/1 day 1 (for western)

2 petri dishes were seeded with 1 million P7 H3122 cells each.

### Next
Treat tomorrow with crizotinib and DMSO control

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 5: H3/criz/24/1 running gel + transfer + 1* antibody

The H3/criz/24/1 samples were run on a 7.5% acrylamide gel in duplicate with 13.5ug of total protein per sample. After transfer the membrane was cut and treated with SRC, p-SRC and b-actin 1* antibodies (made up in BSA and TBST) and incubated overnight.

### Next
Wash, 2* antibody and image tomorrow.
