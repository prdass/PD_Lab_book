## Task 1: Selumetinib SRB 11 day 2

The plate was treated with selumetinib and incubated.

### Next
Continue with the rest of the SRB protocol on 29/11/19

## Task 2: Moving clonal H3122 cells

One colony of H3122 cells was moved from the 96 well plate (FACS plate) into a 24-well plate. The cells were trypsinised with 15uL of tryplE and 175uL of media was added. The entire 200uL of media and cells was transferred to one well of a 24 well plate and an additional 100uL of media was added to make 300uL total in the well.

### Next
Monitor the growth of the cells and move them to a 6 well plate when they have grown enough.
