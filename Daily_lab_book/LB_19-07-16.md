## Overview

Continuing selumetinib replicates

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

1. Selumetinib assay 4 day 2
2. Selumetinib assay 3 data analysis

[Protocol for SRB](../Protocols/SRB_Cytotoxicity_assay.md)

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: Selumetinib assay 4 day 2

The 96 well plate was treated with selumetinib and incubated at 3pm.

### Next
Continue with day 5 protocol on Friday 19/7/19

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 2: Selumetinib assay 3 data analysis

The absorbance of this plate was measured (raw data [here](../Raw_SRB_data/Selumetinib_only)) BUT discovered that I have made an error in calculating the absorbances as a % of the DMSO control for all previous replicates (apart from crizotinib assay 1 which is excluded from final graph)

### Next
Go through and redo final step of excel analysis correctly -> update data in prism -> update objective summaries and final IC50s accordingly <br>
Depending on how the data looks after updating might need to do more replicates?
