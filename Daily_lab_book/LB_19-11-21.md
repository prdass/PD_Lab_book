## Overview

Continuing triple drug SRBs and maintenance of cells for WGS
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

1. Selumetinib SRB 10 day 1
2. FACS plate media change

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: CxAxS SRB 8 day 1
The selumetinib controls in the triple drug combination SRBs are not really consistent with what is expected (more cells killed than expected at 1x the IC50) so going to redo selumetinib alone to see if I can repoduce previous selumetinib data.

2x 96 well plates were seeded with 7000 cells per well with H3122 P9 cells.

### Next
Drug treat with triple drug combination and controls
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 2: FACS plate media change

Media was changed for all plates. Some of the H3122 colonies are growing well and are starting to grow on top of each other so they might need to be moved to a larger plate soon.

### Next
Media change on Monday and suss protocol for moving single cell colonies from 96 well plate to 24 well plate (and volume in a plate)
