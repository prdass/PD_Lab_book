## Overview

Troubleshooting SRBs + reviving CR-H3122s from frozen

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

1. Crizotinib 6/selumetinib 6 assay day 1
2. Cell maintenance
3. Reviving CR-H3122 cells
4. Updating/adding protocols

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: Crizotinib 6/selumetinib 6 assay day 1

Have figured out issue with previous SRBs - all steps except making up of the drug on day 2 needs to be done in media with FBS and penstrep - I was using serum free media for the steps on day 1 as well which will definitely effect the growth of the cells.

Today a 96 well plate was seeded using the P10 flask [split on 18/7/19] using 5% FBS and 1% penstrep media at all stages. The plate was incubated at 12pm today.


### Next
Treat the plate with crizotinib and selumetinib at midday tomorrow 26/7/19

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 2: Reviving CR-H3122 cells

The CR-H3122 cells were transferred to a flask with 10mL of 10% FBS/1% penstrep media + 0.8uL of 10uM crizotinib and incubated.

Revival protocol has been added to protocols folder.

### Next
Allow the cells to adhere overnight and change the media tomorrow to stimulate growth and to remove any dead floating cells. After that change media every 2 days like with normal H3122s

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 3: Cell maintence

From the trypsinised cells generated in Task 1 a new flask of H3122s was split (1:30 ratio) (P11)

### Next
Use the flask to set up SRB on Thursday 1/8/10

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 4: Updating/adding protocols

Have added a [protocol for reviving cells](../Protocols/Reviving_cells.md) from frozen and [added detail for which media to use in SRB protocol](../SRB_Cytotoxicity_assay.md).
