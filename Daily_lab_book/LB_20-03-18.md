------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

1. Western samples - H3/criz/24 #2 and #3, CR/criz/24 #1 day 3
2. CR-H3122 gDNA extraction

## Task 2: CR-H3122 gDNA extraction

DNA was extracted from P4 H3122 cells for WGS, using the same method as the successful H3122 DNA extraction. DNA concentration was 140.986ng/uL and quality was good enough for WGS.
