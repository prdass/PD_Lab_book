## Overview

Clonally purifying H3122s and getting ready to resume 2x weekly SRBs
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

1. Splitting cells
2. Clonal purification of H3122s

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: Splitting cells

The P12 H3122s [split on 31/8/19](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-08-31.md) that were marked as clumpy were discarded. The other P12 flask was split into 2 flasks at 1:3 and 1:10 (P13).

### Next
Split the 1:3 P13 flask on Thursday 8/9/19 and set up an SRB plate. Do the same for the 1:10 flask on Monday 12/8/19.

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 2: Clonal purification of H3122s

From the trypsinised cells from Task 1 [single cell selection protocol](../Protocols/Single_cell_selection.md) was carried out.\
(The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 4mL of media - from this 50uL was taken for the single cell selection. The remaining resuspended cells were made up to 10mL and this was split 1:3/1:10 into new flasks in Task 1)

### Next
Keep checking the plate for wells which have single cell colonies and circle these.
