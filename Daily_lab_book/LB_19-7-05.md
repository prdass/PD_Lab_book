## Overview

Continuing with crizotinib assay 3 and crizotinib 4/selumetinib 1

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks
1. Crizotinib assay 3 Day 5
2. Crizotinib assay 4/Selumetinib assay 1 Day 2

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: Crizotinib assay 3 Day 5

[Day 5 of the SRB protocol](../Protcols/SRB_Cytotoxicity_assay.md) was carried out until the acetic acid wash and dry step. The plate will be stored at room temperature until Monday 8/5/19 when the assay will be continued



### Next
Final steps of Day 5 protocol + data analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 2:

The cells seeded yesterday [5/7/19](../Daily_lab_book/LB_19-7-04.md) were treated with crizotinib and selumetinib as per [Day 5 of the SRB protocol](../Protocols/SRB_Cytotoxicity_assay.md). 4 technical replicates were carried out for each drug although this includes the outer wells - these are more likely to evaporate and skew the results but if the replicates are similar to each other the outer wells will be included in the analysis. <br>
[Crizotinib and selumetinib concentrations](../Protocols/SRB_drug_concentrations.md) <br>
Plate was incubated at 2pm.
### Next
Incubate for 72 hours and carry out Day 5 protocol on Monday 8/7/19 at 2pm
