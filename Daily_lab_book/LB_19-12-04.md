## Task 1: Transferring clonal H3122 cells to 6 well plate

The H3122 cells in the 24 well were about 80% confluent so they were moved to a 6-well plate. The cells were trypsinised with 30uL of tryplE and 270uL of media was added. The entire 300uL of media and cells was transferred to one well of a 6-well plate and an additional 200uL of media was added to make 500uL total in the well.

### Next
Transfer cells to a small flask once the well is 80% confluent.
