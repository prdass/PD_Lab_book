## Task 1: Transfer clonal H3122s to small flask

The H3122 cells in the 6 well were about 80% confluent so they were moved to a small flask plate. The cells were trypsinised with 50uL of tryplE and 500uL of media was added. The entire 550uL of media and cells was transferred to a small flask and an additional 4.5mL of media was added to make a final volume of 5mL.

### Next
gDNA extraction and freezing down of clonal H3122 cells
